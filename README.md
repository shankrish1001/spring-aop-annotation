Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a module within the Spring Framework that provides a way to implement Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

Its primary goal is to increase modularity by allowing the separation of "cross-cutting concerns" from the core business logic of an application.

Cross-cutting Concerns:
These are functionalities that are typically spread across multiple modules or components in an application, such as logging, security, transaction management, and caching.
